# MeetingsMinder

MeetingsMinder is a slack bot meant to integrate with the meetings.amazon.com API for Amazonians to know what their next meeting is tomorrow.

## Local Development

1. Add a `.env` file to this project with `SLACK_TOKEN=xxx`, where `xxx` is the slack bot token that you want to use.
2. Create a local venv by running `python3 -m venv venv`
3. Activate it `source env/bin/activate`
4. Install everything from `requirements.txt` by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
