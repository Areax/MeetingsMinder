# MeetingsMinder
MeetingsMinder is a slack bot meant to integrate with the meetings.amazon.com API for Amazonians to know what their next meeting is tomorrow.

## Local Development
To setup, add a `.env` file to this project with `SLACK_TOKEN=xxx`, where `xxx` is the slack bot token that you want to use. Additionally, you may need to `pip install` the packages that are imported.
